= Creating and changing branches
You can create new branches in {CENTRAL} and name them whatever you like. Initially, you will only have the default *master* branch. When you create a new branch for a project, you are making a copy of the selected branch. You can make changes to the project on the new branch without impacting the original *master* branch version.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Select a space that contains the project that you want to branch.
. Click the project to create the new branch, for example the *{PROJECT}* sample project.
. In the branch menu (the menu next to the image:project-data/branch-icon.png[] icon), select *master* -> *Add Branch*.
. Enter a branch name in the *Name* box.
. In the *From* menu. select the branch that new branch will be based on. You can select any existing branch. The default is *master*.
. Click *Add*.
+
.Add the new branch window

. Use the branch menu to switch between branches.
