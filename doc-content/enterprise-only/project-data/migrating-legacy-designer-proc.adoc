= Migrating business processes to the new process designer

The legacy process designer in {CENTRAL} was deprecated in {PRODUCT} 7.5.0. It will be removed in a future {PRODUCT} release. The legacy process designer will not receive any new enhancements or features. If you intend to use the new process designer, start migrating your processes to the new designer. Create all new processes in the new process designer.

[NOTE]
====
The {PROCESS_ENGINE} will continue to support the execution and deployment of business processes generated with the legacy designer in to the {KIE_SERVER}. If you have a legacy business process that is functioning and that you do not intend to change, it is not mandatory to migrate to the new designer at this time.
====

You can only migrate business processes that contain supported business process nodes in the new designer. More nodes will be added in future versions of {PRODUCT}.

[NOTE]
====
To enable or disable the legacy process designer in {CENTRAL}, in the upper-right corner of the window click *Settings* -> *Roles*, select a role from the left panel, click *Editors -> Select Editor -> (Legacy) Process Designer -> Read*, and then click *Save* to save the changes.
====

If the migration is successful, the business process opens in the new process designer. A copy of the business process file is created with the extension `.bpmn`.
