= Using a custom SSH keystore
You can use a customize SSH keystore service with {CENTRAL}.

.Prerequisite
{CENTRAL} is installed.

.Procedure
. Ensure that the Java class that contains the SSH keystore service that you want to use implements the `org.uberfire.ssh.service.backend.keystore.SSHKeyStore` class, 
defined in the `uberfire-ssh-api` module.
. Specify the Java class name of the service that you want to use in the `appformer.ssh.keystore` system property. If the property does not exist or it contains a wrong value, the default SSH keystore is loaded.
