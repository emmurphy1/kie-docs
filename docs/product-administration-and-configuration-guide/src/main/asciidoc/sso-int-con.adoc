= Integrating {PRODUCT} with Red Hat Single Sign-On

Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) is a single sign-on solution that you can use to secure your browser applications with your REST web services and Git access. This chapter describes how you can integrate RH-SSO with {PRODUCT} and leverage its features.

Integrating with RH-SSO brings an integrated SSO and identity management (IDM) environment for {PRODUCT}. The session management feature of RH-SSO enables you to use different {PRODUCT} environments on the web by authenticating only once.

For more information on RH-SSO, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-single-sign-on/version-7.0/getting-started-guide/[RH-SSO documentation].
