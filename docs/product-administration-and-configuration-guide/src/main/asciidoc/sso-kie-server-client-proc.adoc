.Procedure
. In the RH-SSO Admin Console, open the security realm that you created.
. Click the *Clients* menu item and click *Create*.
+
The *Add Client* page opens.

. On the *Add Client* page, provide the required information to create a new client for your realm. For example:
* *Client ID*: kie-execution-server
* *Root URL*: http://_localhost_:8080/kie-server
* *Client protocol*: openid-connect

. Click *Save* to save your changes.

The new client *Access Type* is set to `public` by default. Change it to `confidential` and click *Save* again.
